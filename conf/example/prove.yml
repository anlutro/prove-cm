# this is an example prove config file. it contains some basic options, but is
# mostly role and target host definitions.

options:
  # local, ssh or remote - this can be overridden on a per-host basis
  executor: ssh
  # console, log or json
  output: log
  log_path: stderr
  log_level: debug

# roles are a way to easily assign matching default variables and states at the
# same time, which reduces duplication.

# this can also be put in /etc/prove/roles.yml or /etc/prove/roles.d/*
roles:
  example_role:
    components: [ example_component ]
    states: [ example_state ]
    variable_files: [ test_vars ]
    variables:
      foo: bar

# target groups are ways to add roles, variables or states to hosts based on
# their hostname, either with regexes or globs. you can also manually add hosts
# to groups. if you give the group a name, when running a prove command from the
# master, you can choose to run only against hosts of the speficied group.

# this can also be put in /etc/prove/groups.yml or /etc/prove/groups.d/*
groups:
  - name: vagrant
    glob: '*.vagrant.local'
    variable_files: [ vagrant ]
  - name: appservers
    regex: 'app\d+\.prod\..*'
    states: [ myapp/deployment ]

# targets are hosts that the master can connect to and give instructions
# you can assign roles, states or variables to each host

# this can also be put in /etc/prove/targets or /etc/prove/targets.d/*
targets:
  - host: localhost
    executor: local
  - host: myserver1.example.com
    executor: ssh
  - host: myserver2.example.com
